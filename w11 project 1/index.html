    <p1 style="color: darksalmon;">
      This project uses a computer to randomly generate balloons of different colors to rise into the sky to represent
      the world as seen by children.I use the “for loop” function to simulate balloons of different colors rising into
      the sky. And I also use “sin” and “map” functions to paint a sun and make the painting richer.In our daily life,
      we are always asked to be a mature adult. We are busy all day long and often neglect the good things in life. But
      in the eyes of a child, all ordinary things become wonderful. Maybe there are times when we should slow down and
      try to see the world through the eyes of a child, and maybe we will find a lot of surprises.

      As a boy, Carl Fredricksen wanted to explore South America and find the forbidden Paradise Falls. About 64 years
      later he gets to begin his journey along with Boy Scout Russell by lifting his house with thousands of balloons.
      On their journey, they make many new friends including a talking dog, and figure out that someone has evil plans.
      Carl soon realizes that this evildoer is his childhood idol.

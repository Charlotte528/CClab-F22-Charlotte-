    <p style="color: darksalmon;" font size=20>
      This project uses a computer to randomly generate balloons of different colors to rise into the sky to represent
      the world as seen by children.I use the “for loop” function to simulate balloons of different colors rising into
      the sky. And I also use “sin”
      and “map” functions to paint a sun and make the painting richer.In our daily life, we are always asked to be a
      mature adult. We are busy all day long and often neglect the good things in life. But in the eyes of a child, all
      ordinary things become wonderful. Maybe there are times when we should slow down and try to see the world through
      the eyes of a child, and maybe we will find a lot of surprises.
